// As soon as we write JSX, Parcel creates bable which

// Babel converts the JSX into code that is understood by browser/React/JS engine

// JSX => React.createElement - JS object => HtmlElement(render)

//JSX code is transpiled into React.createElement. React.createElement is a JS object which is
//  rendered onto the DOM as HTML element. Babel converts JSX code into React.createElement
// Visit Babel.js
