<!-- 
  Not all frameworks can be applied to ana existing app whereas on the other hand React 
  can be applied inside an existing app by using cdn links. That's why React is called as library.
  A library is a collection of packages that perform specific operations whereas a framework contains 
  the basic flow and architecture of an application. The major difference between them is the complexity. 
  Libraries contain a number of methods that a developer can just call whenever they write code. 
  React js is library and Angular is Framework.
  The framework provides the flow of a software application and tells the developer what it needs and 
  calls the code provided by the developer as required. 
  If a library is used, the application calls the code from the library.
