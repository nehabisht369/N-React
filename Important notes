Important notes

- Functional components - normal JS function like Arrow function which return some JSX element

- Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
  XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user.

These three are the same thing: -

- <Title></Title>
- {Title()}
- <Title/>
